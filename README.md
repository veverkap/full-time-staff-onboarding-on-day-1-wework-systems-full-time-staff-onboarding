**NOTE:** This lesson has 4 action items to complete. 

So you've gone through Tech Orientation. How'd it go? It's a LOT of info, am I right? But the good news is you got through it and now we can break down the essentials of what you just got access to. 

**ACTION ITEM** - **Password Manager** - Password managers make your life easier and more secure. If you're not already using one, set one up now. There are several free options like the ones listed [here](https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475964,00.asp), but there is no company standard.

**OneLogin** - Now that you have that password manager set up, make sure to input your OneLogin password to it because you will find yourself visiting this portal often. OneLogin is the single sign on access point to everything include Gmail, WorkDay, HQ IT, WeWork Connect, and Member Network (MENA) - the latter few of which we'll go into more detail about below. 

**ACTION ITEM** - **WeWork Email** - : Like Flatiron School, WeWork uses Gmail for their email server. At some point down the road, we may not maintain two separate email accounts, but for the time being we do. So with that in mind, now that you have access to your WeWork email, immediately start your WeWork emails forwarding to your Flatiron school account. That will ensrue you do not miss any important updates from WeWork, while using your primary email inbox (Flatiron School). If you're not quite sure how to set up email forwarding, check out [step by steps directions from Google.](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en) 

**ACTION ITEM** - **WeWork Slack** - : WeWork has thousands of employees and the best way for them to stay connected is through Slack. With a WeWork commissioned computer you likely already have the deskstop download version of Slack on your computer. If for any reason you don't, [download the desktop version using this link now](https://slack.com/downloads/osx) (it'll save you a world of pain, I promise). Once you have the desktop download version, sign into your WeWork Slack account by adding it as a workspace. You will need your OneLogin credentials for this sign in. 

_Pro-Tip: You won't have cause to use WeWork Slack a ton, but it can be very helpful as a tool to ask questions, find resources, and to communicate with someone in IT if you get locked out of OneLogin._

**HQ IT**: So all is well in the world until it isn't, am I right? So when you need to get that new phone re-authenticated and need a OneLogin reset, or you need some additional tech you didn't get on day 1, HQ IT is your place to make any and all requests. If you can't access it because you are locked out of your OneLogin, please reach out to your manager and request they put in an HQ IT request for you. 

**WeWork Connect**: So there's awesome company called Atlassian that has a product you might be familiar with called JIRA. If you're not that's cool too, but its an online ticketing system that most engineering teams (in particular use). They also have another product called Confluence that provides the tools for an online wikipedia. So in short, WeWork Connect is WeWork's online wikipedia. There are a ton of helpful resources on Connect, and others that aren't as helpful (cause they might not be applicable to you). If you have a WeWork question Connect is a great place to start and you can access it via OneLogin.

_Pro-Tip: Another new way to access Connect content is through WeWork Slack. If you DM "connect-bot" with the phrase "search connect open enrollment" it will pull up five articles that could be related to your query._

**Member Network (MENA)**: The Member Network, known on OneLogin as MENA is the way you can interact with WeWork spaces. Its the tool that enables you to find your nearest WeWork, it let's Community Managers look you up in the system, how you can book spaces, and even buy products at the Honesty Store. 

_Pro-Tip: As a new hire you should get an email that's entitled "Welcome to WeWork" and prompts you to create a username and password, but if you don't get that after a few days from your start, go ahead and submit an HQ IT request and in the title say "New Hire - Need MENA Access."_ 

**New Hire Portal**: Just like Flatiron School, WeWork knows that keeping track of everything that you've got to do is hard. So they are in the process of launching a new hire portal, which is found [here on Connect](https://connect.we.co/display/WO/New+Hire+Portal+Home). While we may use it in the future, for the time being no need to interact with it in any way. Ask Sarah if you have any quetions about this.
